# igotu
A repository on importing, cleaning, and analyzing high resolution igotu data. 

## data
Data was gathered by Dr. Alex McInturff & Dr. Kaitlyn Gaynor at Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) in 2017. 

## project aims
1. Evaluate length and resolution of data (**igotu_exploratory.rmd**)

2. Measure the effect of fence buffer size and fix length on (**igotu_resample.rmd**): 
      * number of fence crossing events
      * behavior classification at fences using BaBA
      
3. Compare fence crossing behavior among individuals (**igotu_demographics.rmd**)
